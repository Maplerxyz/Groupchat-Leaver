# Discord Group Chat Leaver
- This makes your Discord account leave all group chats it is in.
- Does not clear all direct messages, but only groupchats.

## INSTALLING & Selfhosting
- Make sure you have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
- Make sure you have [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/) version that is below 2.0.0 as user tokens don't work on later versions, sadly.
- Put your [token](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgFvgg7ZPI) in `config.json`.
- Run the code (Tested with Python 3.9.6 [64-bit])

## Against TOS
- This is concidered a selfbot, any script that does something to an account is one.
- I am not responsible for anything you do with my code, I made this for educational purposes only.
